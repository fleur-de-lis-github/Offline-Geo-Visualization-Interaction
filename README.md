This project is an interactive visualization of a large dataset tagged by geospatial information. 
Both powerful and challenging, data visualization is one of the hot topics of modern computer science - as well as something that influences our world every day!
It makes use of a package called Unfolding Maps, which is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations.

Unfolding enables you to rapidly create interactive maps. Basic interactions such as Zoom & Pan are included. Other functionality such as Overview+Detail, or multitouch gestures can be easily added. Data Visualization

Simply create geo-positioned markers to display data on a map. The visual style can be adapted freely. The library supports any user-defined shapes, such as points, lines, or polygons. Styled Maps

Unfolding is a tile-based map library. Map tiles can have various geographic features, and come in all kind of styles. It comes with various map providers, such as OpenStreetMap or TileMill. Download
